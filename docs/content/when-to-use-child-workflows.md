### When to use Child Workflows

Some common reasons:

- Execute code using different Workers.
- Enable execution from multiple Workflow Executions.
- Work around [Event History size limits](/docs/server/production-deployment#server-limits).
- Create **one-to-one mappings** between a Workflow Id and some other resource.
- Durably execute some periodic or asynchronous logic like `sleep` or `await`.

### When not to use Child Workflows

The question of when to use Child Workflows vs Activities sometimes arises. Here is why you might _not_ want to use a Child Workflow:

- **Lack of a shared state with the Parent Workflow Execution.**
  Parent Workflow Executions and Child Workflow Executions can communicate only through asynchronous <a href={props.signalsLink}>Signals</a>.
  If the executing logic is tightly coupled between Workflow Executions, it may simply be easier to use a single Workflow Definition that can rely on a shared object's state.
- **Cost**: Child Workflows carry more event history overhead compared to Activities, and this may matter for large Temporal workloads.

If in doubt, we recommend using Activities over Child Workflows until you see a clear need.

A child workflow can be hosted by a separate set of workers that donâ€™t contain the parent workflow code. So it would act as a separate service that can be invoked from multiple other workflows.
A single workflow has a limited size. For example, it cannot execute 100k activities. Child workflows can be used to partition the problem into smaller chunks. One parent with 1000 children each executing 1000 activities gives 1 million activities executed.
A child workflow can be used to manage a resource using its ID to guarantee uniqueness. For example, a workflow that manages host upgrades can have a child workflow per host (hostname being a workflow ID) and use them to ensure that all operations on the host are serialized.
A child workflow can be used to execute some periodic logic without blowing up the parent history size. Parent starts a child which executes periodic logic calling continue as new as many times as needed, then completes. From the parent point of view, it is just a single child workflow invocation.
